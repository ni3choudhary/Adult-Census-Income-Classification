# Adult-Census-Income-Classification Using R Programming

- I have used the US census data to build a model to predict if the income of any individual in the
US is greater than or less than USD 50000 based on the information available about that individual
in the census data.
- Did a detailed analysis on adult census income dataset.
- Built a Machine Learning model using R Language that will predict whether Income Exceeds
$50K/yr.
